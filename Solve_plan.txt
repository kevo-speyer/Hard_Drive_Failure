Plan to Solve problem:

1) Explore data to get the most important attributes using T-test and ANOVA. 
   Divide population by tag ( failure = 0, failure = 1 ), and see which attributes
display a significant different distribution in each group. Dimension of the problem should decrease notably.

Done with T-test! Run exploration.py to see output of this stage (and be patient, might take ~ 5min) 

Optional) Get the optimum linear combination of relevant attributes by doing a PCA. See wether dimensionality can be brought down even more (Maybe not necessary)

3) Implement algorithms to predict failure:
	- Logistic Regresion ( DONE! )
	- ADA Boosting
	- Random Forest
	- k-neares neighbors

4) Cross Validation (75%, 25%), ver ROC curve y AUC

5) Compare Quality of Solutions with ROC curve
